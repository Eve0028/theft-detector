Lukács et al., 2016

"All studies by the present author utilize **mean amplitudes within 100‐ms segment**s. Also, although the study by Soskins et al. (2001) recorded the NEG wave using .3 Hz high‐pass filter settings, recent studies by the present author **utilize a .16 Hz setting, close to the .1 Hz** value urged by Tanner, Morgan‐Short, and Luck (2015) as “optimal for statistical power in detecting true effects while not introducing distortions.”
