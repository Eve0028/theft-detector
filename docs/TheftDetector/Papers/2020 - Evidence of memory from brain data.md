"_Innocent-but-informed participants._ Other work focused on assessing the ecological validity of a P300-based CIT demonstrated that prior knowledge of crime details has an effect on detection rates, illustrating potential risks of using probes that may have become known to an innocent subject (such as someone who received instructions to steal a ‘ring’ but did not go through with the crime).[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8249088/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#fn63) These ‘innocent-but-informed’ participants were ‘essentially indistinguishable’ from those who actually committed the mock crime: ‘Simple knowledge of probe items was sufficient to induce a high rate of false positives in innocent participants’.[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8249088/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#fn64) Rosenfeld and colleagues counsel that crime details must remain secret, known only to police, perpetrators, eyewitnesses, and victims. But how feasible is it for investigators to know for certain that the probed details are, indeed, secret? This may be easier said than done, and it is not always possible to know the degree to which critical details about the event in question have been inadvertently disclosed. Further relevant to forensic application, the studies investigating variables reviewed in this section have not distinguished between witnesses (who may be innocent-but-informed) and participants (‘guilty’ subjects), such that variables such as time delays and quality of encoding are poorly understood in applications of detection of witness (rather than suspect) memory."
